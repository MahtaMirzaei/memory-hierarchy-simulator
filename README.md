# Memory Hierarchy Simulator

## Overview

This project simulates a memory hierarchy system including cache levels, main memory and disk storage. It allows users to analyze cache performance using different replacement policies such as LRU, FIFO, LFU, MFU & ..

## Features

- Simulate multiple cache levels with customized hit times(L1, L2, L3)
- Implement and compare different cache replacement policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO, Random, ..)
- Display performance metrics such as hit rate and miss rate and AMAT for a given set of addresses.
- Can be used to compare different methods of replacement policies for a set of addresses.
