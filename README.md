# Memory Hierarchy Simulator

## Overview

This project simulates a memory hierarchy system including cache levels and main memory. It allows users to analyze cache performance using different replacement policies such as LRU, FIFO, and Random.

## Features

- Simulate multiple cache levels (L1, L2, L3)
- Implement and compare different cache replacement policies
- Display performance metrics such as hit rate and miss rate

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone httpsgithub.comyourusernamememory-hierarchy-simulator.git
   cd memory-hierarchy-simulator
